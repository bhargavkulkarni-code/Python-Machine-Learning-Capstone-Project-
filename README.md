Problem Statement - The BigBasket dataset has information about index, product, category, subcategory, brand, sale price, market price, type, rating, description etc. here do the exploratory data analysis, work on descriptive analysis and apply neccessary machine learning algorithms find the best accuracy machine learning models.


Tools used - pandas, statistics, matplotlib, seaborn, plotly, exploratory data analysis , machine learning algorithms ( linear regression, decision tree regressor, random forest regressor, support vector regressor.


Achievements - Found best accuracy of machine learning model ( linear regression 94% ) this helps bigbasket to predict sale price with 94% accuracy. this helps bigbasket to take neccesary decisions on sale price in the future with this it earns profit.
